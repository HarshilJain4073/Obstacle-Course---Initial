# Project Name: Obstacle Course
This project is a simple 3D game where players control a cube to navigate obstacles and reach the final platform. The cube can move up, down, left, and right to dodge randomly summoned balls and rotating crosses. The goal is to reach the final platform while avoiding collisions.

## Features:
- **Simple and intuitive controls:** Players can move the cube in all directions using keyboard controls.
- **Randomly generated obstacles:** Balls and rotating crosses are summoned randomly to create challenging gameplay.
- **Dynamic 3D environment:** The game takes place in a 3D environment with a square base, providing an immersive experience.
  
## Technologies Used:
- **Unity3D:** Game development engine for creating the 3D environment, implementing gameplay mechanics, and rendering graphics.
- **C# Programming:** Used for scripting game mechanics, player movement, obstacle generation, and collision detection.
- **3D Modeling:** Basic 3D modelling techniques for creating the cube player, balls, crosses, and final platform.
- **Game Physics:** Utilized Unity's built-in physics engine for realistic movement and collision interactions.
